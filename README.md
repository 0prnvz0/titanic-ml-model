# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction ML Model

A beginner Machine Learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Decision Tree Classification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a classification model that predicts passenger survival based on passenger details such as ticket class, age, fare, and family members aboard.

This project focuses on understanding the basic Machine Learning workflow including dataset handling, model training, and prediction.
